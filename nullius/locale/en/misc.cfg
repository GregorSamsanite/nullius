nullius-intro=You're a von Neumann android.  After hundreds of years of relativistic travel, your probe has arrived at its target planet, and you've been activated with a small payload of essential equipment.  This lifeless planet is relatively poor in heavy elements and lacks a breathable atmosphere.  Despite these minor deficits it's overall classified as a superb candidate for terraforming.  Your mandate is to develop the industrial capacity necessary to terraform this planet, seed it with life, and build a wave of successors to continue on to new planets.

nullius-mission=You've completed the first phase of your mission by establishing a large and advanced industrial outpost on this remote, barren planet.  The next phase is to leverage this capacity to terraform the planet.  You have access to a panel tracking progress on each remaining objective, and a new button to manage this panel.  Your mission will be considered a success when all tasks have been cleared.\n\nYou must seed 3 plant and 3 animal species.  Genomes can be downloaded once you establish satellite contact with the interstellar network.  Release them into the wild using drones, which mention optimal surroundings for each species.  Animals require atmospheric oxygen.\n\nRaising the global oxygen level is another objective.  Plants released into the wild will gradually increase oxygen levels over time.  The oxygen (or compressed oxygen) you vent will also contribute to the atmosphere.  Any hydrogen or other reducing gases you vent will cancel out some oxygen.  You must also reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide by sequestering it away as coal and petroleum.\n\nThis planet is deficient in heavy elements, which you will need to remediate with asteroid mining.  Two objectives are for creating new rare mineral deposits.  You also must reshape the alien landscape using terraforming drones to replace exotic terrain with soil better suited to new life.\n\nFinally, you will need to propagate the wave of terraforming across the galaxy by creating duplicates of yourself and launching them in ships to other planets that are potentially suitable for terraforming.

[mod-description]
nullius=In this Factorio prequel, you're an android terraforming planets and seeding them with life. Replaces all recipes and technology. No life means no coal, oil, wood, biters, or free oxygen, requiring varied renewable energy sources. For reliability, you'll focus on abundant elements from the air, sea, or common minerals such as iron ore, bauxite, sandstone, and limestone. Advanced technology enables asteroid mining of rarer elements.  Visit mod portal for a more exhaustive description and a list of compatible mods.

nullius-align-first-intro=You're a von Neumann android.  Your probe has arrived at a barren planet with a mandate to terraform it, seed it with life, and build a wave of successors to continue on to new planets.  You've detected signs that other probes may be approaching this planet, but you're the first to arrive.  Use this head start to prepare for potentially hostile interference, until you can determine if they're operating according to compatible directives.  If so, work together to achieve them faster, otherwise reprogram them to share your goals or race to outcompete them.  Prepare for a rough landing as you begin to enter the atmosphere.
