nullius-intro=You're a von Neumann android.  After hundreds of years of relativistic travel, your probe has arrived at its target planet, and you've been activated with a small payload of essential equipment.  This lifeless planet is relatively poor in heavy elements and lacks a breathable atmosphere.  Despite these minor deficits it's overall classified as a superb candidate for terraforming.  Your mandate is to develop the industrial capacity necessary to terraform this planet, seed it with life, and build a wave of successors to continue on to new planets.

[mod-description]
nullius=In this Factorio prequel, you're an android terraforming planets and seeding them with life. Replaces all recipes and technology. No life means no coal, oil, wood, biters, or free oxygen, requiring varied renewable energy sources. For reliability, you'll focus on abundant elements from the air, sea, or common minerals such as iron ore, bauxite, sandstone, and limestone. Advanced technology enables asteroid mining of rarer elements.  Visit mod portal page for a more exhaustive description and a list of compatible mods.
