title_nullius=Nullius: A Factorio Prequel

page_nullius_text_1=In this Factorio prequel, you play an android sent to terraform barren planets and seed them with life. Eons later your efforts will result in a galaxy full of planets ready for engineers to crash land on. This is a full overhaul mod that replaces all recipes and technologies. No life means no coal, oil, wood, biters, or free oxygen in the atmosphere. Furthermore, since many planets are poor in rare heavier elements like copper or uranium, your technology will focus on the most abundant, lighter elements.

page_nullius_text_2=The fundamental natural resources are Iron Ore, Sandstone, Bauxite, Calcite, Air, Seawater, and Volcanic Gas. Advanced resources like copper and uranium become available later with asteroid mining technology. Bauxite is an ore for aluminum, a useful electrical conductor and structural material. Calcite is a source of calcium, useful in cement, glass, and metallurgy, and is also a source of trace amounts of sulfur. Sandstone provides silicon, essential for electronics and glass, plus trace quantities of titanium ore. Air consists mostly of nitrogen and carbon dioxide (a critical feedstock for organic chemistry products like plastic), but has traces of other important gases including noble gases like argon and helium. Seawater is a source of hydrogen, oxygen, chlorine, sodium, and trace amounts of deuterium, tritium, lithium, and other minerals. Volcanic gas is a source of sulfur, carbon monoxide, and trace amounts of boron.

page_nullius_text_3=Once you've established a sufficient industrial base to launch rockets, your endgame goals are to seed this planet with life and to launch duplicates of yourself to repeat this process on other planets throughout the galaxy. You will need to raise the atmosphere's oxygen level and seed a genetically diverse ecosystem of multiple plant and animal species each with their own survival requirements. You must reestablish communications with your progenitors to download genomes of these species, and assemble biological materials from scratch until you have a sufficient breeding stock to reproduce itself naturally. Many of these species produce useful materials more cheaply than you can manufacture them, so you may wish to integrate some of these organisms into your factory production lines.

menu_mods=Mods
title_mods=Mods
page_mods_text_1=This mod uses different resources, technologies, and recipes, so it does not interact well with other mods that have their own technologies and recipes unless they have specifically been adapted to work with Nullius. Quality of life mods without their own techs and recipes may just work. Certain common mod gameplay features are already integral to Nullius in some form, including waterfill features, item stacking, and infinite ores.  A select number of mods with technologies have already been ported to work with Nullius.  Others are expected to be added. This compatibility may be added either by Nullius or the other mod.
page_mods_text_2=Mods known to already be ported include: Miniloader, Transport Drones, Jetpack, Factorissimo2, LTN - Logistic Train Network, LTN Combinator Modernized, Bob's Adjustable Inserters, Safe Waterfill, Teleporters, Advanced Fluid Handling, Warehousing, Robot Replacer, AAI Signal Transmission, Train Supply Manager (TSM), Induction Charging, Stack Combinator, Text Plates, Resource Spawner Overhaul (RSO), and I,Robot.

menu_research=Research
title_research=Research
page_research_text_1=Nullius has 7 research packs.  The first 2 are unlocked very early, and the next 5 are progressively more advanced and exponentially more expensive.  Thus the technology tree can be divided into 6 distinct tiers.
page_research_text_2=Nullius replaces all vanilla technologies, so the names and progression are very different than what you may be used to.  Nearly anything that you can do in the base game, you can do in Nullius, with the exception of a few military or energy technologies, but it may come in another form.  Nullius attempts to streamline away some unnecessary intermediates and instead uses finished products as intermediates or overloads items with multiple uses.
page_research_text_3=Some examples:  Cliff explosives and explosives are not separate items; Nullius explosives are an intermediate product that also blows up cliffs.  There is no separate personal battery equipment; regular batteries are equipment, intermediates, and rechargeable vehicle fuel.  Radars are called sensor nodes, and the key difference is that they have a much smaller radius for scanning distant sectors (an aspect that is more necessary with biters), but a larger radius for remotely viewing your factory from the map view.  Instead Nullius provides a different method for scanning very distant sectors under the exploration technology.

menu_early=Early Game
title_early=Early Game
page_early_header_1=Tier 1, Geology and Climatology Research
page_early_text_1=You start out with no recipes at all, but the first technology unlocks geology samples, and does not itself require any research packs, only time in the lab.  Your lab is available somewhere in the wreckage of your craft.  You will start out with access to just enough of the buildings that you will need to progress far enough to start crafting all of these buildings yourself.
page_early_text_2=Geology and Climatology are simple and cheap to produce.  Technologies in this tier have very low costs and are meant to be researched quickly.  They serve as introduction to processes for manufacturing essential materials for the next research tier.
page_early_header_2=Tier 2, Mechanical Engineering Research
page_early_text_3=Mechanical engineering is not quite as simple to produce, but technologies at this tier still require only small numbers of research packs.  These technologies enable you to build your own copies of most of the structures that you start the game with, thus enabling you to expand your base indefinitely.  By the end of this tier you will have the ability to eliminate all of your waste byproducts, thus enabling sustainable automation.
page_early_text_4=Since you cannot properly scale up manufacturing at all without these essential mechanical technologies, most technologies of this tier and earlier are unaffected by the technology cost multiplier setting.

menu_mid=Mid Game
title_mid=Mid Game
page_mid_header_1=Tier 3, Electrical Engineering Research
page_mid_text_1=Now that you can build your own labs and a larger factory, research starts becoming more expensive.  Electronics enable more sophisticated control, automation, and customization features, including the first appearance of bots, modules, train signals, long inserters, and combinators.  It unlocks tier 2 versions of most of the basic production structures, as well as some new types of structures.
page_mid_header_2=Tier 4, Chemistry Research
page_mid_text_2=Chemistry unlocks new uses for existing resources and many new materials, enabling useful tools such batteries and explosives.  It also has the tools for true mass production.  Intermediate products may be boxed for greater transportation throughput, and new recipes allow for directly producing boxed materials from other boxed materials.  Similarly, gases may be compressed for greater throughput and more efficient chemistry.

menu_late=Late Game
title_late=Late Game
page_late_header_1=Tier 5, Physics Research
page_late_text_1=The research is vastly more complex to produce, almost requiring at least some use of bots to automate, but since you produce many at once the resource cost is comparable to earlier tiers.  This tier enables you to build the third and final tier of most basic structures.  It enables new features such as mass scale terraforming of your environment with drones, and rocketry necessary to progress to the endgame in the next tier.
page_late_header_2=Tier 6, Astronomy Research
page_late_text_2=This is the endgame.  At the start of this tier, after launching your first rocket, you will be assigned a mission panel with a tracker of your goals.  These tasks will disappear as they reach 100% progress, and you win when they're all complete.  Besides research, you may use your rockets for asteroid mining, allowing you to establish stationary mining outposts with renewable minerals.  Many of the technologies at this tier are infinite, though their exponential costs will eventually grow beyond reach.  These infinite technologies a good motivation for continuing your manufacturing to megabase scales, even after accomplishing your basic terraforming goals.

menu_fluids=Fluids
title_fluids=Fluids
page_fluids_text_1=Chemistry and fluid handling are critical parts of the Nullius crafting system, so it's important to understand how to manage fluids.  There are certain areas where Nullius diverges from vanilla fluid handling to be aware of.

page_fluids_header_1=Pressure
page_fluids_text_2=Nullius has the concept of a "pressure" rating for pipes and tanks.  This is an abstraction that uses features of the Factorio game engine's fluid simulation to create pipes with varying throughput.  A major effect of the greater "pressure" rating is that Pipe 4 transfers significantly more fluid per second than pipe 1.  A vanilla pipe would fall somewhere between a Nullius pipe 1 and 2 in throughput. This effect is complicated to achieve in Factorio and has a few side effects.
page_fluids_text_3=The pressure rating of each pipe and tank is listed in the tooltip. When pipe 1 is completely full, it achieves its maximum pressure of 40%. When pipe 2 is full it's at 60%, pipe 3 is 80%, and when pipe 4 is full it's 100%. Tanks can handle a little more pressure than pipes. 100% of what? An arbitrary amount that the best pipes can handle. This system is just an abstraction that isn't meant to refer to a fixed amount of real world pressure.
page_fluids_text_4=Since pipe 1 and 2 never achieve 75% pressure, even when full, they are not compatible with the relief valve which has a threshold of 75%. Tank 1 does go over 75%, so it can be used with a relief valve. The trick is that if you hook up a tank 1 directly with a pipe 1 it will only get approximately half full due to the pressure difference. This can be solved with pumps, which will fill a tank completely regardless of the pressure of the source. This is the reason that relief valves become available with the same technology as pumps, since they are unusable in the early game without pumps.

page_fluids_header_2=Waste Byproducts
page_fluids_text_5=Many chemical processes in Nullius produce 2 or more products.  Any time that happens, it is likely to create a waste byproduct, since you are unlikely to use all of the products in exactly the ratio they are produced.  Disposing of unwanted waste fluids is essential to sustainable automation.
page_fluids_text_6=Hover over the fluid icon to read the tooltip. Fluids may be gases or liquids.  Most gases can be vented in a chimney and most liquids can be vented in an outfall. However, some are marked as non-disposable, and cannot just be vented. All byproducts can be destroyed in some way, but there may be more steps required. Hydrochloric acid, for instance, must be neutralized by caustic solution first. Benzene must be combusted into disposable gases. Some solids, such as sodium hydroxide or gravel may be processed into fluid for the sake of disposal.  Most key waste disposal technologies are available by the end of the mechanical engineering technologies. In the early game prior to that point you may need to build some chests or manually clear tanks.
page_fluids_text_7=Valves are essential for managing complex webs of products and byproducts.  Relief valves are used to vent waste if a tank is filling up and at risk of backing up production, without wasting it if the tank is not full.  Auxiliary valves allow you to send fluid to a secondary output only if there is enough to satisfy a more important consumer first.  Top-up valves allow you to fill a tank only if it's running low, but still leave some room for it to also be produced as a byproduct without going to waste.
page_fluids_text_8=Something to keep in mind is that Chimney 1 and Outfall 1 are inefficient and will not completely drain a pipe. The source must fill up a bit to overcome their resistance before they will start venting. Pumps may be useful to keep fluids moving.

menu_energy=Energy
title_energy=Energy
page_energy_text_1=With no life in Nullius, there is no coal, wood, or oil, and no oxygen in the atmosphere to burn it anyway.  This requires the use of renewable energy sources.
page_energy_text_2=Wind power is the lowest tech option to become available, and early in the game it is your only real option.  Later in mechanical engineering, you gain access to solar thermal, which is more expensive, but the heat can be saved up to be used at night or when winds are low.  Starting in the electrical engineering stage, you have a range of options with different strengths and weaknesses.  Wind requires a lot of land and is unpredictable.  Solar panels can be expensive and produce nothing at night.  Geothermal produces consistent power, but may only be placed on volcanic fumaroles.  Nuclear produces consistent power and can be built anywhere, but consumes some resources to do so.
page_energy_text_3=Wind turbines have to be spaced out exactly 32 tiles from one another, so they take up a lot of space. Using grid aligned blueprints or the f5 grid view may help you to plan out neat spacing. Placing them will get easier when you research pylon 1, since those reach exactly the 32 tiles that you need to place 1 per turbine. Don't be afraid to build a large wind farm, since there are no biters, so you don't need to defend that territory. The bots you start out with might help with placing blueprints.

page_energy_header_1=Energy Storage
page_energy_text_4=Since wind and solar produce variable amounts of power, they require energy storage.  Battery storage is not available until chemical engineering technology, due to the limited elements available to make them with.  Until then, you can build your own "accumulator" equivalent systems using electrolysis or compressed gas, using surge electrolyzers or surge compressors.  The surge electrolyzer only operates with surplus power, just like an accumulator stores power.  You can save the hydrogen and oxygen it produces in tanks when your wind or solar are producing extra energy, then burn it for power when they are not producing enough energy.  The turbine will only consume steam if your wind and solar aren't producing enough power.
page_energy_text_5=It's worth considering using these surge electrolyzers even in your regular production, instead of the more conventional priority electrolyzers. Surge electrolyzers have a high maximum throughput, so they can fill tanks during times of abundant energy, and the rest of your base can keep running by using the stored products from tanks at times when the electrolyzers aren't running. Electrolysis is one of your main energy consumers, so keeping it flexible in this way can reduce your minimum energy requirements and reduce your need for energy storage. The downside is that if you are consistently running low on power, you may not see an obvious symptom like brownouts, but instead will see your hydrogen running low.
page_energy_text_6=Steam temperature in Nullius is merely cosmetic.  Higher temperature reactions yield a greater volume of steam relative to their input, and it's the number of units that matter.  Each unit of steam has a certain amount of energy, visible in the tooltip, so it's easy to calculate how much energy is stored in a tank.  The same turbines that consume steam will also consume other compressed gases, which each have a certain amount of listed energy per unit.  Compressed nitrogen is the most common choice of energy storage medium, since air separation provides a steady supply of surplus nitrogen as a byproduct.
