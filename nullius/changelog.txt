Version: 1.6.0
Date: 29.08.2023
  Features:
    - WARNING:  Some changes in this major update may not just work seamlessly
      in an existing factory without taking some time to fix it up.  You may
      choose not to update during an existing playthrough if you don't want to
      deal with any disruption.  If you do upgrade, maintain a save from before
      the upgrade in case you decide to go back.  Some items are combined into
      fewer items, and some new items are added.  Any recipes involving the
      changed items may be adjusted accordingly.  In particular, this may
      require attention in your mall area for recipes using turbines, and in
      your biology area for recipes involving wood.
    - Two new end game mission objectives:  coal and petroleum.
    - Four new biology objective checkpoints.
    - Two new intermediates with new recipes:  aluminum powder and wood chips.
    - Pipe connections of fluid buildings can now be flipped using a new key
      bind after building, rather than by using separate mirrored items.
    - Priority of turbines, electrolyzers, and compressors can now be toggled
      with a new key bind after building, rather than with separate items.
    - New implementation of turbines using composite entities.  They are now
      divided into 2 types, "open" and "closed".  Open turbines behave more
      similarly to the prior implementations.  Closed turbines produce around
      5% less energy per fluid, but recycle around 90% of the working fluid,
      either uncompressed gas for compressed gas, or water for steam.  The
      precise ratio recovered varies according to the working fluid.
    - Priority turbines are now renamed exhaust turbines, and will reliably
      consume fluid regardless of whether the energy is required.
    - Oxygen or oxygen reducing gases consumed by a turbine now count toward
      atmospheric oxygenation mission objective as if vented.  Previously this
      wasn't the case due to technical limitations with vanilla turbines.
    - New chirality checkpoint.
    - New methanol and graphite combustion, and oil incineration recipes.
  Changes:
    - Seawater intakes now require power.  Already placed intakes will keep
      working without power for compatibility, but newly built ones will not.

      Rocket fuel, graphite to carbon monoxide, PEX plastic, egg harvesting.
